# Bug Severity Classification using Genetic Algorithm and K-Nearest Neighbors

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **classifying bug reports** from the **Firefox dataset** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning techniques**. The goal is to predict the **severity of a bug** based on its textual description. We employ **TF-IDF** for text vectorization and **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for feature selection, followed by a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier for severity prediction.

## Key Features
- **Preprocess bug reports** (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and punctuation cleaning).
- **Feature extraction** using **TF-IDF vectorization**.
- **Feature selection** using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to optimize model performance.
- **Bug severity classification** using **KNN**.
- **Performance evaluation** using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
